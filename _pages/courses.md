My courses concern two main topics : Geographic Information Science and Climate Sciences.

# Undergraduate level
## Geographic Information Systems GIS (20h)
Instructors : Thierry Castel, St√©phane Follain, Marjorie Ubertosi

### Content and organisation
The courses focus on the introduction of GIS principles and environmental applications. First, main GIS specificities and deriving functionalities are exposed to point how and why GIS differ from numeric cartography or database management systems. Second, main functionalities are presented towards spatial analysis methods. Both vector and raster spatial operators are described. Third, mapping capacities for various domains of applications are described. Finally, two cases studies on soil and water/pollutant transfers support the GIS model-based added value o study and manage environment.

## Climate Sciences primer (6h)
Instructors : Thierry Castel, Pascal Roucou

### Content and organisation
The lecture takes place within the Climate-Soil module (24h). Only few hours are dedicated to Climate sciences. The main aims is to present key climate concepts such as large scale dynamic, energy budget and regional water cycle. Focus are made on climate changes and their impact on crop systems through climate water balance.

## Climate change impacts (24h)
Instructors : Thierry Castel, Annabelle Larmure

### Content and organisation
This optional courses presents elements of climate change and ecophysiology of crops. Link between climate and crop are depicted through various mechanisms in order to show how warming may impact perenial (grapvine) or annual crop (winter pea). Large part is dedicated to applications. First exploratory data analysis is conducted to characterize how climate warm since 1960s. In a second step we apply a phenological and a frost stress model to assess the impacts on crops. Finally, based on these results and bibliographic materials various adaptation ways are studied.

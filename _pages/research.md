My research focuses on the regionalization of climate information. The main emphasis of my work is to study the regional to local patterns of surface climate variability in the context of climate change from daily to inter-annual scales, through the analysis of observations and numerical simulations. I focus on the current and projected climate mainly over the EuroCordex domain. Recently, I have worked on topics including the regionalization of climate change information for impact assessment on a wide range of systems such as : crops, forests and water ressouce.
